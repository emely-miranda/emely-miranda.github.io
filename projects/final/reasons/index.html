                        <h2>Group Lifespan</h2>
                        <p>Let's examine BTS, who is, in popular opinion, the most successful and well-known K-pop
                            group.</p>
                        <p>BTS debuted in 2013 with seven members -- RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook--and
                            are still active after 11 years (though they are technically on hiatus due to South Korean
                            military law).</p>
                        <p>The group had a seven-year contract. At their debut, Jin, the eldest member, was 21. The
                            <strong>maknae</strong>, Jungkook, debuted at 15 after training for three years. In 2020,
                            the
                            members, now all in their 20s, with fantastic popularity and a Grammy nomination, renewed
                            their contracts for another seven years.
                        </p>
                        <p>The group will continue to bring large profits to their company. Companies are banking on
                            idols who debut young with long contracts and are more likely to renew contracts—prolonging
                            their lifespan.</p>

                    <h2>Development</h2>
                    <p>Before becoming idols, people are <strong>trainees</strong>. Being an idol requires a lot of
                        physical labor, from practicing choreographies to improving vocals.</p>

                        <p>Her start in K-pop preceded her debut as a YG Entertainment artist. In 2017, when she was 9,
                            she debuted in the kid's girl group U.SSO. YG invited Rora to audition; she got in and had
                            been training since 2018. She debuted in 2023 at 15 and is the second youngest member.</p>
                        <p><em>"I saw the potential,"</em> CEO of YG Entertainment, Yang Hyun-suk, said. <em>"I was very
                                sure that if we work on her voice well, it will turn out great."</em></p>
                        <p>Younger people retain more information. They can learn choreography and songs quickly, tire
                            out less and keep up with the changing times. Companies can shape trainees into the best
                            performers, singers and dancers they can be.</p>

                        <p>South Korea has a particular beauty standard. There is even a position for the group member
                            who best fits the standard: the <strong>visual</strong>. The K-pop audience, especially the
                            domestic
                            audience, prefers youthful-looking idols even if they are in their 30s. Tying into the
                            reasoning of the lifespan of groups, if an idol debuts at an early age, as time goes on,
                            they still look young but are now more mature as they've reached their peak on the K-pop
                            scene.</p>
                        <p>Soloist Sunmi was part of the second-generation K-pop group Wonder Girls and the groups'
                            visual. She
                            and the maknae debuted at the age of 15. Even now, at 32 years old, she is still extremely
                            popular
                            and has a loyal fanbase.</p>
