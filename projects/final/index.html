                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>When trying to become a singer, people typically post covers online, submit demos to labels or do
                        whatever they can to get discovered. Then bam! After a year or so, they release a single or an
                        EP and claim their success.</p>
                    <p>Becoming a singer—especially in <strong>K-pop</strong>—is slightly different in <strong>South
                            Korea</strong>. <strong>Idols</strong> must undergo long training periods, honing their
                        skills and preparing for their <strong>debut</strong>, a journey not for the faint-hearted and
                        not everyone sees through.</p>
                    <p>Korean pop, or K-pop, emerged in the 1990s and has since transcended borders, becoming a global
                        sensation of immense influence.</p>
                    <p>K-pop is divided into generations based on its impact. We are currently in the 5th generation.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5">

            </div>
            <p>The success of previous generations has led companies to debut an abundance of new groups. Between
                January 2023 and April 2024, over 60 K-pop groups have debuted.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="container">
            <p>Excluding duos and groups not classified as pop, approximately 53 groups debuted during the first
                generation, and approximately 67 groups have so far debuted in the fifth generation.</p>
            <element id="note">
                <p><em>NOTE: "No data" means that the ages of members of group could not be found.<br>This data is
                        not proportional or
                        meant to be compared for many reasons. The biggest of which is that the number of groups is
                        unequal.
                        The
                        second reason is that many members are born the same year. For example, the youngest members,
                        Rosé
                        and
                        Lisa, of third generation girl group BLACKPINK are both born in 1997, but only the
                        maknae of the
                        group
                        would be counted—Lisa.</em></p>

                <p>While a good portion of idols debut in their mid to late teens or early adulthood, they spend
                    many
                    years
                    prior training and preparing for it.<br>This raises the question, <a

                        idols
