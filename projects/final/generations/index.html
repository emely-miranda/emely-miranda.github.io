            <h1>Generations</h1>
            <h2>First-gen (1990s-2004)</h2>
            <p>The genre made headway with Seo Taiji and the Boys in 1992. The group incorporated Western influences,
                new sounds and choreography into their music, marking the beginning of the first generation, which is
                associated with laying the foundation for future groups and the founding of entertainment companies that
                planned to create the next big thing.</p>
            <h2>Second-gen (2005-2011)</h2>
            <p>The second generation is associated with innovating the newly created training system and exploring
                international possibilities. Groups gained traction with dance practice videos and appearing on reality
                or live television shows. At the very end of this generation, PSY's "Gangnam Style" was released,
                officially launching K-pop on the world stage.</p>
            <h2>Third-gen</h2>
            <p>Now catapulted into the limelight, third-gen groups faced immense pressure to maintain the genre's
                popularity. (I call it the Golden Age of K-pop.) Third-generation groups were invited to international
                talk shows, music festivals, award shows, etc., garnering more people's attention. There was also an
                increase in brand endorsements and collaborations with artists outside South Korea as companies found
                ways to market their groups. Another, yet negative aspect of this generation is the apparent fandom
                rivalries and toxicity stans in the K-pop community.</p>
            <h2>Fourth-gen</h2>
            <p>Fourth-generation groups are called "the future of K-pop." Various groups debuted with an established
                fanbase, as fans of third-generation groups and followers of entertainment companies anticipated their
                debut. Groups succeeded despite continuous comparisons to previous generations and global issues such as
                the pandemic. </p>
            <h2>Fifth-gen</h2>
            <p>We are in a new era of K-pop: the fifth generation. The anticipation of fifth-generation groups is
                similar to that of fourth-generation groups. Companies have documented the formation of groups and
                published them online, allowing audiences to feel a part of the growing experience and even pick out a
                <strong>bias</strong>. <strong>Pre-debut</strong> singles have also become more prevalent.
