        <p>The <b>Granny Smith</b>, also known as a <b>green apple</b> or <b>sour apple</b>, is an apple cultivar that
            originated in Australia in 1868.[1] It is named after Maria Ann Smith, who propagated the cultivar from a
            chance seedling. The tree is thought to be a hybrid of Malus sylvestris, the European wild apple, with the
            domesticated apple Malus domestica as the polleniser.[citation needed]</p>
        <p>The fruit is hard, firm and with a light green skin and crisp, juicy flesh. The flavour is tart and acidic.
            It remains firm when baked, making it a popular cooking apple[2] used in pies, where it can be sweetened.
            The apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripe.[3] The US Apple Association
            reported in 2019 that the Granny Smith was the third most popular apple in the United States of America.[4]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <img src="images/320px-Granny_Smith.jpg" alt="Maria Ann 'Granny' Smith (1799-1870)">
    <section>
        <p>The Granny Smith cultivar originated in Eastwood, New South Wales, Australia (now a suburb of Sydney) in
            1868.
            Its discoverer, Maria Ann Smith (née Sherwood[5]), had emigrated to the district from Beckley, East Sussex
            in
            1839 with her husband Thomas.[6] They purchased a small orchard in the area in 1855 and 1856 and began
            cultivating fruit, for which the area was a well known centre in colonial Australia. Smith had eight
            children
            and was a prominent figure in the district, earning the nickname "Granny" Smith in her advanced years.[7]
        </p>
        <p>he first description of the origin of the Granny Smith apple was not published until 1924.[8] In that year,
            Farmer and Settler published the account of a local historian who had interviewed two men who had known
            Smith.
            One of those interviewed recalled that, in 1868, he (then twelve years old) and his father had been invited
            to
            Smith's farm to inspect a chance seedling that had sprung near a creek. Smith had dumped there, among the
            ferns,
            the remains of French crab-apples that had been grown in Tasmania.[9] Another story recounted that Smith had
            been testing French crab-apples for cooking, and, throwing the apple cores out her window as she worked, had
            found that the new cultivar had sprung up underneath her kitchen windowsill. Whatever the case, Smith took
            it
            upon herself to propagate the new cultivar on her property, finding the apples good for cooking and for
            general
            consumption.[10] Having "all the appearances of a cooking apple," they were not tart but instead were "sweet
            and
            crisp to eat."[6] She took a stall at Sydney's George Street market, where the apples stored "exceptionally
            well
            and became popular" and "once a week sold her produce there."[6]</p>
        <p>Smith died only a couple of years after her discovery (in 1870), but her work had been noticed by other local
            planters. Edward Gallard was one such planter, who extensively planted Granny Smith trees on his property
            and
            bought the Smith farm when Thomas died in 1876. Gallard was successful in marketing the apple locally, but
            it
            did not receive widespread attention until 1890. In that year, it was exhibited as "Smith's Seedling" at the
            Castle Hill Agricultural and Horticultural Show, and the following year it won the prize for cooking apples
            under the name "Granny Smith's Seedling." The apple was so highly successful that the following year, many
            were
            exhibiting Granny Smith apples at horticultural shows.[7]</p>
        <p>In 1895, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture recognised the cultivar and had begun growing the
            trees at
            the Government Experimental Station in Bathurst, New South Wales, recommending the gazette of its properties
            as
            a late-picking cooking apple for potential export. Over the following years the government actively promoted
            the
            apple, leading to its widespread adoption.[9] Its worldwide fame grew from the fact that it could be picked
            from
            March and stored till November. Enterprising fruit merchants in the 1890s and the 1900s experimented with
            methods to transport the apples overseas in cold storage. Because of its excellent shelf life, the Granny
            Smith
            could be exported long distances and most times of the year, at a time when Australian food exports were
            growing
            dramatically on the back of international demand. Granny Smiths were exported in enormous quantities after
            the
            First World War, and by 1975, 40 percent of Australia's apple crop was Granny Smith.[10] By this time, it
            was
            being grown intensely elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, as well as in France and the United States. The
            advent of the Granny Smith apple is now celebrated annually in Eastwood with the Granny Smith Festival.[11]

    <h3>Culinary</h3>
    <section>
        <p>Granny Smith apples are light green in colour. The tart flavor of these apples makes them one of the most
            versatile varieties of apple to cook with. They are popularly used in many apple dishes, such as apple pie,
            apple cobbler, apple crumble, and apple cake. They are also commonly eaten raw as table apples, and at least
            one company (Woodchuck Hard Cider) makes Granny Smith varietal cider.</p>
    </section>
    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <section>
        <p>It is moderately susceptible to fire blight and is very prone to scab,[12] powdery mildew, and cedar apple
            rust.</p>
        <p>Granny Smith is much more easily preserved in storage than other apples, a factor which has greatly
            contributed to its success in export markets. Its long storage life has been attributed to its fairly low
            levels of ethylene production, and in the right conditions Granny Smiths can be stored without loss of
            quality for as long as a year. This cultivar needs fewer winter chill hours and a longer season to mature
            the fruit, so it is favoured for the milder areas of the apple growing regions. However, they are
            susceptible to superficial scald and bitter pit. Superficial scald may be controlled by treatment with
            diphenylamine before storage.[13] It can also be controlled with low-oxygen storage.[14] Pit can be
            controlled with calcium sprays during the growing season and with postharvest calcium dips.[15]</p>
        <p>According to the US Apple Association website, it is one of the fifteen most popular apple cultivars in the
            United States.[16]</p>

        <p>In 1968, the rock band The Beatles used an image of a Granny Smith apple as the logo for their corporation,
            Apple Corps Limited. For their record label, Apple Records, one side of vinyl albums featured the exterior
            of the fruit, while the other side of the recording featured a cross-section of the apple.[17]</p>
        <p>Yoko Ono's 1966 artwork Apple used a Granny Smith apple in its 2015 recreation at New York City's Museum of
            Modern Art. John Lennon had taken a bite from the apple on display in its 1966 incarnation at the Indica
            Gallery in London.[18]</p>
        <p>The Granny Smith was one of four apples honored by the United States Postal Service in a 2013 set of four 33¢
            stamps commemorating historic strains, joined by Northern Spy, Baldwin, and Golden Delicious.[19]</p>
