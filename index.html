                    <h2>Hello! My name is Emely Miranda-Aguilar.</h2>
                    <h3>Early Life</h3>
                    <p>I grew up in Hyattsville, MD, near Washington, D.C. My parents are immigrants from El Salvador,
                        and I am proud, to call myself a Salvadoran American. I spoke English and Spanish as a child and
                        have remained fluent in both.</p>
                    <p>As a kid, my family and I watched Spanish news broadcasts such as Univision, Telemundo, or CNN
                        en Espa√±ol. As I got older, I paid more attention to the local papers: the Hyattsville Life &
                        Times and the Hyattsville Wire, and watched other news outlets on TV, primarily CNN
                        and NBC.</p>
                    <p>I grew up in a time where cameras are everywhere. You witness individuals getting hurt and others
                        achieving their goals. You see countries at war and others celebrating their independence. Media
                        is everywhere, but it is important to learn about the things going on in the world.</p>
                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>In sixth grade, I became involved in the school newspaper at Nicholas Orem Middle School. I was
                        one of four students in charge of layout design. At Northwestern High School, I was a member of
                        the Student Government Association, the debate
                        club, the Math Honors Society and the yearbook. During the pandemic, I
                        participated in Prince George's Community College's dual-enrollment program and took two English
                        courses. I graduated from high school with honors in 2022.</p>
                    <p>I began attending the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, College
                        Park in Fall 2022. I
                        am majoring in multiplatform journalism and plan to specialize in investigative journalism. I am
                        also pursuing minors in history and French. I work for various campus publications, including
                        Stories Beneath the Shell, La Voz Latina and The Diamondback. Additionally, I have interned and
                        freelanced for local papers. I hold memberships in the Society of Professional Journalists and
                        the National
                        Association of Hispanic Journalists.</p>
                    <h3>Interests</h3>
                    <p>Journalism has evolved into a career that comes in many forms. Throughout college, I have
                        experimented with many media: news writing, photography, web design, editing, audience
                        engagement, etc. I enjoy them all. My main areas of interest are investigative and news
                        reporting on minorities and underrepresented communities, as well as feature writing and
                        editing.</p>
